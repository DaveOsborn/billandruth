 Ruth Winifred Lenton (on marriage Osborn)  **1921 &ndash; 2015**

## Birth and Early youth.

I was born April 30<sup>th</sup>, 1921 in Barry South Wales, in the Methodist manse overlooking the park. My father was a Methodist minister at a time when it was common for them to move every 3 years.

When I was 15 months old we moved to Summerseat, near Bury, Lancashire, and before we left my elder sister Jessie went to the local grammar school and my brother Arthur applied to go to Manchester Grammar School, a very good school where my father contrived to keep him by moving round in Lancashire as follows:

* 1922 &ndash; 1925 Bury Circuit
* 1925 &ndash; 1928 Middleton
* 1928 &ndash; 1931 Padiham, near Burnley
* 1931 &ndash; 1934 St. Helens
* 1934 &ndash; 1937 Bolton

I went to infant and junior schools in Middleton and Padiham.

As we were about to move, I was allowed to take the <q>eleven-plus</q> a year early. In spite of having missed half a year of school at the age of eight with Chorea (St. Vitus’ Dance) I passed for a Grammar School and went to one at St. Helens and later to the Bolton School. As a result of St Vitus’ Dance, my writing was very untidy and I failed at Art and Needlework, but academically did very well in all other subjects.

I am unable to roll my <q>R</q>s with my tongue and had difficulty saying Ruth, and got the nickname “Foofie”. This annoyed me and made me quickly learn to roll my “R”s in my throat. I was able to demonstrate how to do this in my first French lessons!

Jessie was 8 years older than me and her secondary school was next door to the Infants school in Middleton, so she took me to school. In Padiham I often walked with the Headmaster of the Junior School who lived nearly opposite to us.

Padiham had a triangular grassy garden from which I could watch all the coaches going from Yorkshire to Blackpool. My brother had to leave for school so early in the morning that I rarely saw him much in the week. Cricket with him in the garden at Middleton at weekends was great fun – a batsman hitting down the leg side down the side of the house could reach the front garden and score 6; hitting over the wall to next door was 6 and out.

## 1937 – 1939.

My parents moved to Otley in Yorkshire. My sister had already graduated from Manchester University and begun to teach at a mixed boarding school for “City of London” pupils in Ashtead, Surrey. Arthur had just finished Oxford Greats and began to teach at St. Bee’s School in Cumberland.

I had only just begun in the sixth form so I became a boarder at the Music-mistress’s house in Bolton. I was taken to and fro at the beginning and end of term by the recently acquired first car! In these last years I was leader of the school choir, and sang Chibiabos’s part in the production of Hiawatha. I was angry that we only had musical productions which did not cater for my friend who could *act* but not sing!

Apart from school in these years, I was not aware very much of what was going on in the rest of the world. The music teacher did not have the radio news on, as my parents did. However, in 1939, I had already passed Higher School Certificate and was applying to study Geography in University. I went to Girton for interviews and knew by March that I’d been accepted. So I spent most of the summer term in Caen with a French family who spoke no English, but could convey their anxieties about possible war to me in French.

In the summer holiday, I went to a course in Cranham, Cotswolds, where other continental students awakened me more to the situation.

## 1939 – 1940 War &amp; Cambridge student.

When war broke out I was home all September in Otley and helped receive a lot of ‘refugees’ – children from schools in Leeds only 10 miles away. They started work in localprimary and secondary schools, but in the ‘false war’ when nothing much happened, they were soon taken back home! I was busy sewing black material to line my long curtains to cover Girton windows. When I went up I was sharing a room with Mary Parr, who I had met at Cranham preparing to do map-making, etc. We were strong friends all through college, visited one another on our bicycles in vacations as her parents lived in Batley and mine in Rothwell, just South of Leeds. We have been pen friends ever since until Mary (Taylor – married name) died in 2006. I keep in slight contact with her eldest, Jocelyn, who is my God-daughter.

Girton managed catering very well with little change from peace-time food, but College societies, games, etc were more limited than in peace-time, and most students took it as a privilege not to be taken from their studies.

In the second and third years men-students became rarer in Geography and other departments. Several parts of London University, Uni College itself and LSE were evacuated to Cambridge.

## 1940 - 1942.

MethSoc and Methodist groups based at Wesley House, as a theological college not so bereft of men, were important to me. Bill and I happened to be members of the same Methodist group but took no notice of each other! The boy I knew best was called up in my second year there, and Bill left the following year to go into Civil Defence.

My brother, Arthur, and I both registered as conscientious objectors, though for a woman this was only a modest witness to pacifism. Arthur was taken from his tutoring job in 1941,having been dismissed earlier from St. Bees Public School and he also worked in Civil Defence. By then he was married to Mary Foster of Whitby.

Arthur was in Portsmouth and had a great deal of rescue work to do.

In my last year at Girton, Olive Osborn arranged a walking holiday in youth hostels in the Yorkshire Dales. It was then I began to know her brother more and arranged a visit to their home.

## 1942 – 1945.

When I completed my Geography Honours Degree, I moved to the Oxford Education Department for training and Bill visited me there on one occasion in 1943, before the end of term. By this time I had offered to go for missionary service and had been provisionally accepted, but advised to have at least one year of teaching experience in Britain.

I was appointed as Geography teacher in a relatively small school for boys and girls at Eckington, near Sheffield.

I enjoyed the experience – apart from the accident on November 30th. I was hurrying down the steep hill to Eckington village on my bicycle at lunch break, to take staff pay cheques to put into the bank. Near the bottom of the hill, I braked too hard and went over the handlebars.

I am told I complained at once about my bloodied knee; but the more serious injury, to my head, caused concussion so severe that I don’t remember anything till waking up in hospital the following day.

I was kept lying flat for a week and was sick every time I even tried to raise my head. My parents had to use war-time trains to visit me from Rothwell, near Leeds, when I was South of Sheffield!

An ambulance took me home just a fortnight later and I gradually recovered. Bill was granted leave from Civil Defence in North-West London to visit me over Christmas, and I was well enough to return to teaching at the beginning of the spring term.

Later in the summer term Bill and I were engaged, but as he was still in the Civil Defence I was still willing to go temporarily to missionary teaching as there was no prospect of getting married yet. The Mission House was short of people towards the end of the War, so was willing to send me on an 18-month service in a school in Oron, Eastern Nigeria.

## 1945 – 1946.

I arrived at Lagos in January 1945 and travelled for three days and nights round from Western via Northern to Eastern Nigeria, with a final 75-mile bus ride from the nearest station to Oron. 

I lived in a house with large overhanging roofs and verandas, and many open windows, first with Evelyn Durrant, a considerably older assistant, and then with Barbara Pitt, the Principal, when she came back from furlough.

The square compound had dormitories on three sides where about a hundred girls lived and a large schoolroom on the fourth side where all the younger girls had their lessons.

My work, with the older class who could learn in English all the time, was in a smaller room near the house.

By September 1945 the building across the road for a smaller teacher training unit was completed. The first students admitted in January (only 7 in all) were my responsibility.

Chief harvest and holidays were in December and January.

I spent two Christmases there, staying among those 75 miles away in Uzuakuli, site of a leper colony and of a fairly large training college for men and women on a different site nearby. Fellow missionary couples were friendly and generous with hospitality.

By post, Bill was keeping me informed of plans for a wedding soon after I got home. He was not released from Civil Defence till April 1946 after the war had ended but got a job starting late summer as a research assistant in Statistics.

I got home in early August, 1946, and at once applied for a marriage licence. My parents now lived in Bangor, North Wales, so the marriage arranged for September 14th was relatively quiet, with only the closest of Bill’s family able to come by train from the London area, and not many of my relatives either. However, my father led me down the aisle of a little Methodist Church in the shelter of a steep cliff in Bangor and we travelled in the train to a honeymoon in Ross-on-Wye.

Bill had begun negotiations for a house being sold in Hayes, Middlesex, but we spent three months with Bill’s brother Sidney and his wife Dorothy till the purchase was completed, and we moved in during the Christmas break.

During the first three months, Mr Lee-Perkins, Bill’s boss at the Educational Research Centre, was our lodger. It was a very cold winter and he wore one pair of very thick socks for weeks to make his “extremities” warmer. I could not persuade him to put them in the wash!

He moved out in May, and I went to part-time teaching in the summer. An interview for Bill in late May brought an offer for research in the Cambridge Economics Department, and abandoning contraception had immediate results. Bill started at Cambridge in September, lodging with a Methodist and looking for a house. Meanwhile, Dulcie Wallis, one of the 5 or 6 in the Lodgers Club at Hayes Methodist Central Hall, came to live with me. [The Lodgers Club had an annual party which continued till the year 2000] 

## 1948 – New Year’s Day.

115 Histon Road, Cambridge was now vacant and we moved in. I was heavily pregnant and Stephen was born in Mill Road Maternity Hospital in late February. 

Much of the next two and a half years was absorbed in looking after him in our small, poorly-heated cottage between a fish-and-chip shop and an entrance to an area of grass. However it had a good long narrow garden where Bill could grow many items to supplement the rations, which were more limited in the years after the War than during it. Fish and chips were a frequent treat!

## 1950 – Liverpool.

Bill was appointed to be a junior assistant lecturer in Liverpool and after a holiday in Gorleston, Norfolk, we moved to a nice, three-bedroomed, semi-detached house in Aigburth, 5 minutes’ walk from the large Sefton Park and Lake and a ten-minute walk from the “Prom” along the tidal Mersey.

Those who had pitied us moving from Cambridge to Liverpool had no idea how much our lives changed for the better! When Liverpool places and people appear on TV, I still long for it! 

Immediately after arrival, John was on the way and was born in June, 1951. I have early memories of many walks in the Park and on the Prom, with John in pram and later in pushchair and Stephen trotting along beside it.

 Aigburth shops were handy and good for all kinds of food and we occasionally went into town for major items, cinema and rides on the ferry across to Birkenhead, New Brighton and other places on the Wirral. Gi, my childhood minder when I lived in Summerseat, was the chief person to visit there in their big Heswall house with a large garden.

## 1955.

Andrew was born at home. As I scarcely had time to reach hospital for John’s birth, I had arranged this, with a helper booked for six weeks after the birth. It was memorable to look at Stephen and John’s smiling wonder when they came in to see new-born Andrew!

Among visitors who stayed with us, a few were Nigerian missionaries just arrived home or just waiting for a boat back again.

## 1958 – 1959.
Plans were made to move to a bigger house in Mossley Hill opposite the cricket ground. It was a long way from the kitchen wing perched looking towards the North to the dining room at the front facing the South. By now Bill had full lecturer status and we sometimes had meals with invited students who enjoyed being with small children. 

It was not long before Stephen gained a scholarship to the ‘Institute’ in town and Andy started to cross the field in John’s care to go to Infants School. 

## A Car!

Soon after going to Kylemore, Bill bought a car. I learned to drive it at the time of the popular song, “Keep your mind on the driving and your hands on the wheel, and keep your beady eyes on the road ahead, I’m having fun, sitting in the back seat, kissing and ahugging with Fred!” I had quite a lot of long driving practice to the Peak District when my parents went to the Methodist Home for the Aged in Hathersage.

After 18 months there was a change of warden in charge of the MHA, and my father led the protests about the changes she made and he was asked to find accommodation elsewhere! They went to friends in North Wales for a while and we visited them there with the car but after a while they moved to an upstairs flat in one of the Closes going down
from Aigburth Road to the river-side.

My father, now 87, walked to the shops for mother and seemed energetic but in a few months was ill, taken to hospital, and died in November, 1964. My mother lived at the flat for a further year but then we began building an extension for her – a two-storey wing with a garage at ground level and a long bed-sitting room with a door opening out onto the halflanding.

Mother moved in and lived there nearly 2 more years, getting increasingly helpless.

## Last 2 years in Liverpool.

Stephen completed his degree and wanted to do further training as a Planner in Nottingham. John was just finishing at school doing well in Maths and Science and was accepted to a course at Liverpool University in 1969.

Bill was increasingly frustrated by the leaning of the Professor and most of the staff to Economics as an Arts subject focusing on Economic History. His work in Statistics was not valued and one student who failed in it was nevertheless awarded a first class. So Bill decided to apply to use his Statistics in the Civil Service and was accepted to go to London in 1969.

We therefore moved to Edgware, dropping some items off to Stephen’s new flat in Nottingham en route.

## Edgware. 1969 – 1976.

It was not easy to find friends in Edgware as most people were busy commuters, and the Jewish Community was numerous and self-sufficient.

Andy went to a school fairly near and after a year I worked for London YWCA – not very effectively - in looking for suitable lodgings for young people.

John stayed in Liverpool for two years studying Engineering, but he was not happy and eventually came to London and started on Accountancy, a course he liked and completed gradually, working within a local firm of accountants.

Meanwhile I returned to teaching 2 days a week, with the car at my disposal I could go to a “superior” school in Harrow on the Hill!

John met Mary at Edgware Methodist Church and married her and lived nearby.

Andy completed school and went to the Southlands Methodist teacher training college in Wimbledon. He eventually met Roz and brought her to the farewell garden party we arranged when the Civil Service had opened a new Statistics Office in Newport, and wanted Bill to move there. We were glad because we were not very fond of suburban life and long journeys to work.

## [WILPF](http://wilpf.org/).

I first met the [Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom](http://wilpf.org/) when we went to Liverpool and joined the local branch as a fairly inactive member for most of the time there, but Ethel Dransfield ‘dragged’ me to Executive meetings in London and I was the Branch Rep. on it for 1967 to 1969.

In London I became much more involved, going every Wednesday to the Parliamentary Committee which studied Hansard and decided what was relevant to write to the Government about, sending suggestions and sometimes copies of a circular letter which a large number of members could send to their MPs.

I went to my first International Congress in Denmark in 1971, where the next Triennial Conference was being planned to take place in Selly Oak (Birmingham).

By 1974, I had been made National President, and as such was the chief hostess (helped byBill)! I then became a member of the International Executive which met annually in different places: Birmingham, Paris, Sweden, Norway, US, etc. I then went to other Triennial Congresses in Gothenburg, New Delhi, New Haven and Hiroshima, Japan.

I was for six years an International Vice President, chairing some of the sessions. My two ‘special’ tasks were to persuade new countries to join (contacts in Africa were very helpful) and to chair the Middle East Sub-Committee and sessions of each meeting devoted to the Middle East. Our Lebanese member was another of the Vice-Presidents and probably enabled more peaceful discussions with the Israeli delegates than happened before or since!

## 1976 – 2002 Newport – the longest I’ve lived anywhere!

Bill started work there in September, 1976, having found and offered for 10 Melbourne Way before he started – and moved in to sit on a chair with a table in the front room, and basic kitchen things to give himself evening meals. I stayed three months more in Edgware trying to sell the house. Eventually I did and we were able to arrange a full removal on New Year’s Eve – 1977 began with both of us sorting ourselves out!

We left John and Mary in Edgware and after several years, John sought out a new accountant’s firm in Southampton and moved to where they still live in nearby Totton.

Andy continued in contact with Roz, got engaged in 1976 and married the following year. They lived in Wimbledon for the first year of marriage while Andy completed his B.Ed. Degree at Southlands. They then moved out to Surrey living in two different houses near the schools where they teach.

Stephen was a planner, first in Bradford, then in Wakefield, and a bachelor coming home more frequently than the others.

In Newport, Bill worked at the Business Statistics Office till he retired in 1981. I worked part-time for ‘Tenovus’, a mainly cancer charity, but my job was to look for needs and helppeople in Newport. I identified the need of elderly ‘shut-in’ people for a means to open the front-door OR keep it locked when visitors came. Automatic telephone-controlled door-openers were installed with controls next to where the semi-invalid usually sat. Twelve of these were installed and my job was to visit and care for them in other ways. This was paidwork for a year, but I continued contact with them and organised outings for and with themvoluntarily for several years. Most of them had died or gone into residential care by the time we left.

The Methodist Church in Newport was a relatively new building in our Glasllwch estates and attracted many who were not ‘born Methodists’. Its many activities kept both of us busy and, as local preachers, we often visited more isolated Methodist Churches up the Eastern valleys.

I was involved with Women’s Work and Women’s Fellowship and became WW District Secretary. The WF Committee met in the morning in Cardiff and the WW followed later the same day. Several women, like me, were members of both committees and so we were glad in 1987 when the two were combined in ‘Network’. (The 20th birthday of Network is this year, when I am writing this.)

## Family in 1980s and 1990s.

John and Mary continued in Totton; Andy and Roz continued in South Godstone, where Laura was born in 1980 and Sheena and David arrived with 15 months between each! Stephen visited home most at first; but on a holiday in Switzerland met Mary from Ireland and got her a night’s stay at Andy’s before she could get a plane home from Gatwick. He continued to see her and we visited her parents in Sligo on an Irish holiday and were there the next year at their wedding (1983). Catherine was born in 1990 and Hugh in 1991.

## Bill and Ruth 1990 – 2002.

We continued in Newport, busy in many ways. Bill was Secretary of the One World Week group comprising Samaritans (he was one), Christian Aid, R.C. groups, Peace groups including WILPF, etc. We all had stalls in John Frost Square on the Saturday on One World Week, having each had one meeting or similar activity some time during the week.

We together hoped to enthuse others in the need to work for a fairer, more peaceful, more Christian world than before.

In 2001 we were both 80 and gradually began to withdraw from responsibilities in various directions with a view to moving nearer one of our family. We began looking in 2001 and the next year we were able to move to the present bungalow in Old Catton in Norwich, about three quarters of a mile away from Stephen and his family.

## 2002
We both were freed from our community responsibilities and most people here have no idea of all the things we have done and been involved with in the past. I occasionally went to London meetings of WILPF in the first 2 years, but not at all lately.

We enjoyed contact with, and help from, Stephen and Mary and their teenage children.

This year, 2007, we did not manage our planned holiday in North Norfolk and Bill died peacefully in June. I finish here, having written this in November and December, 2007.

## Post-script by Andy Osborn, Ruth's youngest son.

My mother died on January 10, 2015. In the last few years of her life she gradually lost hersight and a stroke made speech very difficult. Her mind remained keen though, and her hearing very sharp.If you have read her memories and wish to know more about her life, I include some links below that I hope will add further depth to this account.
